# Modification History
# - This code was first written on 10th September 2021.
# - The Code has been submitted to be reviewed by Dr. Richard Goodrum on 13th September 2021 

# Procedures:
# main: Recieves two numbers as inputs from the user and 
#       does airthematic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication & division)

# Data Segment :
# This segment is where data is stored in RAM. It is set as key value pairs
# syntax: label: .type value(s)
#
# Types Used :
# - ascii  : This is used to declare a string which does not have a null at the ed. This causes the next declared string to 
#            be part of the same label. Used here to have a multi-line initialization of label.
# - asciiz : This is used to declare a null terminated string. The null here is needed to imply the end of the string.
#            The charecters in the string is encoded using ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
.data 

	# Below I have initialised few messages that willl help provide a discriptive output to the user
	prompt1:	
		.ascii  "Welcome to Programming Assignment!!"
		.ascii  "\n\nThis program will take two integers (A & B) as input from the user and output the airthematic"
		.ascii  "\noperations performed on them."
		.ascii  "\nNote: The program is limited to numbers between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647."
		.ascii  "\nIf the multiplication of the two inputs yield values greater than this range, overflows can be possble."
		.asciiz "\n\nPlease enter an integer value for A: "

	prompt2:.asciiz "Please enter an integer value for B: "
	sum:	.asciiz "\nA + B: " 
	sub1:	.asciiz "\nA - B: "
	sub2:	.asciiz "\nB - A: "
	multi:	.asciiz "\nA * B: "
	div1:	.asciiz "\nA / B: Quotient: "

# main: 
# This is the primary function that executes the entire code. 
# In this program we get two integers between â€“2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. 
# However due to limitation on multiplication size of 32 bit so if the value 
# of the multiplication is more than 2,147,483,647, there could be issues of overflow.
# 
# Arguments: None
